Chat feature merged from test1 into PRM392-Final.

What's added:
- Java: ChatActivity, ChatFragment, adapters, models, utils, FCMNotificationService under package com.example.prm392
- Layouts: activity_chat.xml, fragment_chat.xml, chat_message_recycler_row.xml, recent_chat_recycler_row.xml
- Dependencies added in app/build.gradle.kts: Firestore, Storage, FirebaseUI Firestore, OkHttp, Glide
- Manifest: INTERNET permission + FCMNotificationService

To wire it up:
1) From HomeActivity or your navigation, start ChatActivity with an Intent that includes the other user's UserModel fields:
   intent.putExtra("username", ...); intent.putExtra("phone", ...); intent.putExtra("userId", ...); intent.putExtra("fcmToken", ...);

2) Ensure your Firebase project (google-services.json) in :app is valid and has Firestore and Cloud Messaging enabled.

3) If you see missing resources (colors/styles), copy any needed styles or drawables from test1 project.

4) If you don't want Firestore (and prefer Realtime DB), you'll need to adapt FirebaseUtil accordingly.
